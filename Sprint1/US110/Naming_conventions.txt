Every name of table, columns, etc should be as short as possible and identify the table, column, etc and leave no doubt
If there more than 1 word is needed both words need to be separated by '_'
Words always singular
Tables always start with uppercase letter
Columns always start with lowercase letter
Primary Keys and Foreign Keys are always like 'id_' + the identification of the column

Contraints:
	add 'PK' - for primary key constraints
	add 'FK' - for foreign key constraints
	add 'UQ' - for unique constraints
	add 'CK' - for check constraints
